Based on earlier experiences with the Polaric Tracker and a need for a updated tracker we was thinking of designing a new unit that was based on affordable modules and relatively easy to build for radio amateurs. It was also able to the internet (for config, for uploading tracks, to function as a igate,etc). The first lab-models and prototypes were based on a Teensy-3 microcontroller board and a ESP-12. The role of the ESP control the Wifi and provide a simple webserver for configuration of the tracker. It was programmed in LUA (NodeMCU). It had limited memory and barely room for the webserver. The Teensy was more capable and able to encode and decode APRS packets, decode GPS NMEA strings and control the whole thing. It was written in C.
