This is a guide how to get a tracker up and running with a basic configuration rather quickly. The *Arctic Tracker* firmware runs on several hardware platforms: The Arctic Tracker 4 VHF and UHF/LoRa version and the LilyGo T-TWR-plus 2.0. 

The firmware can be built from the source using esp-idf. Or installed from a binary archive if this exists for the hardware. A USB/serial command shell gives full control over settings. The tracker can also be configured through a web-interface or a smartphone app using WIFI. It is possible to use the tracker as an access point and connect to it. For full control it is recommended to use the command shell at least the first time.
