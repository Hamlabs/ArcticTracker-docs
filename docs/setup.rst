 
Basic setup
===========

Initial setup - using the command shell
---------------------------------------
The Arctic Tracker offers a serial console (command shell). This lets you control every setting and has some commands for testing, debugging, etc. It is a useful tool when developing. It is recommended to use it the first time you start the tracker for setting the wifi access point and access-key. When you plug in a USB-C cable and connect it to your computer a serial interface should appear (on Linux it is /dev/ttyACM0). A good old serial terminal program will probably work. The monitor command of idf.py (if you have the esp-idf installed), should also work. You may need to reset the tracker to get up the command prompt (cmd>).
